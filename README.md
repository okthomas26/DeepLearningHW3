# DeepLearningHW3
Download the repository from GitHub and download the DeepLearningHW3 folder from the Google Drive. The Google Drive contains the trained model. The spokenSquad folder contains the data. Only unaltered (no noise) data was used. Once you have downloaded all the files, run the Test.ipynb file.
